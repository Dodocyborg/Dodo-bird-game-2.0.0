Introduction

Welcome to Dodo Bird Game! Originally an endless runner, this game is evolving into an open-world 3D action-adventure game with RPG elements. In the future, you'll be able to:

Explore vast, open worlds, including forests, deserts, cities, and even outer space.
Customize your character and buy avatars, weapons, and upgrades from the in-game shop.
Go on exciting missions to defeat monsters, collect resources, and uncover hidden treasures.
Eventually journey into outer space, battle alien species, and discover new planets!
This game is built for both single-player and multiplayer modes, where you can interact with other players in the lobby and embark on missions together. The game is available for commercial use, so feel free to integrate or distribute it as part of your own product.
